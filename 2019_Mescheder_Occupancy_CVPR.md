## Notes
+ Unlike images, in 3D there is no canonical representation which is both computationally and memory efficient yet allows for representing high-resolution geometry of arbitrary topology. 
+ Many of the state-of-the-art learning based 3D reconstruction approaches can hence only represent very coarse 3D geometry or are limited to a restricted domain.
+ Propose Occupancy Networks, a new representation for learning-based 3D reconstruction methods.
+ Occupancy networks implicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of a deep neural network classifier. This representation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolution without excessive memory footprint.
+ Experiments to demonstrate applications for the challenging tasks of 3D reconstruction from single images, noisy point clouds and coarse discrete voxel grids.
